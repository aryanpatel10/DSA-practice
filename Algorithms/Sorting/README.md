# 🔢 Sorting Algorithms

This folder contains implementations of popular **sorting algorithms** written for learning, practice, and interview preparation.

Sorting algorithms are used to arrange data in a specific order (ascending or descending) and form a core part of **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**.

---

## 📂 Algorithms Included

- 🫧 **Bubble Sort**
- 🧩 **Insertion Sort**
- 📌 **Selection Sort** (upcoming)
- ⚡ **Quick Sort** (upcoming)
- 🧬 **Merge Sort** (upcoming)

Each algorithm includes:
- Clear explanation
- Step-by-step working
- Time & space complexity
- Clean and readable code implementation

---

## 🧠 Why Learn Sorting Algorithms?
- Helps understand **time & space complexity**
- Improves problem-solving skills
- Frequently asked in **coding interviews**
- Used internally in many real-world systems

## ⏱ Complexity Comparison

| Algorithm       | Best Case | Average Case | Worst Case | Space |
|-----------------|-----------|--------------|------------|-------|
| Bubble Sort     | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)  |
| Insertion Sort  | O(n)      | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)  |
| Selection Sort  | O(n²)     | O(n²)        | O(n²)      | O(1)  |
| Merge Sort      | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n log n) | O(n)  |
| Quick Sort      | O(n log n)| O(n log n)   | O(n²)      | O(log n) |
